# hello-world
Following the github tutorial is reasonably simple.
However, it focusses on using github, and using git from the 
command line is a different thing. So that is a seaparete
project altogether.
So the flow in the command line is like this:
git clone <url>
cd <new-directory>
git branch more-edits
git checkout more-edits
Make changes to README.md and save
git add README.md
git commit -m "more edits to README.md"
